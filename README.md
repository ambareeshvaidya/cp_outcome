# To Cut Or Not To Cut, That Is The Question

Cutting planes, or cuts, are a relaxation-tightening technique employed by mixed-integer programming solvers, due to cutsâ€™ beneficial effect on average across diverse instances. However, cuts do not always help. We study the effect of the cuts parameter in SCIP, an open-source optimization solver, using instances from the 2017 Mixed Integer Programming Library. Our results verify that, although the default setting of cuts-on does provide on average a faster solving time than cuts-off, a significant number of instances are actually solved faster by disabling cuts. Further, we train a classifier to approximate the virtual best solver for whether to set the parameter cuts-on or cuts-off for each instance. We achieve this by collecting early indicators at three points in the solver to make a binary decision (cuts-on/cuts-off).

** Notes **
We use Python 3.8 and SCIP 8.0 with its python API PySCIPOpt 4.2.0. The `numpy` and `pandas` libraries are employed for data manipulation, all plotting is done with `matplotlib` and `seaborn` and we employ `scikit-learn` for the machine learning experiments.

We divide the implementation into three main steps:
* Data Collection: each instance is run with five different (consistent) random seeds once each by setting the cuts parameter to on/off. We extract vital information during the solving process using `callbacks` that have already been implemented in PySCIPOpt. This data as well as data available directly from the MIPLIB website is used to make the final features for each instance.
* Ablation Study: once the data is compiled and cleaned for any irregularities we conduct the ablation study to determine the efficacy of the `cuts-on` setting.
* Machine Learning Experiments: we prepare the data to conduct three separate machine learning experiments
